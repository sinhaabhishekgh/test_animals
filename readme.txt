This file talk about approach that followed for the assignment.


Key areas:-


1) Major category, either they are Mammal, fish, bird, etc. This classifies their major difference, a 5K feet view

2) Attributes,  to further drill down, a list of attributes defined so they can be implemented used decorator pattern to design as per needs

3) A factory is created to create objects which hide the actual implementation and give only the object by attributes

4) Due to short of time, Some amount of test cases written

5) Code is modular can be extended in any form of concrete validation and to cater any future needs

6) voice calculation kept keeping of SOLID principles and values can be modified easily in app properties file
